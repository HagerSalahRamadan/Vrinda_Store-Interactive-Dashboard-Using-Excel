   - Western dresses have moderate demand, suggesting an opportunity for growth.

   

### 3. Doughnut Chart (#Orders by Gender)

   - Women account for 69.4% of total orders, while men contribute 30.6%, This suggests that female customers are the dominant purchasers in this dataset.

   - Men Are an Underserved Market Segment: The significantly lower percentage of male orders indicates a potential gap in marketing for men.

   - 1.7% of orders are canceled, 3.4% refunded, and 2.7% returned, which highlights some operational inefficiencies.
